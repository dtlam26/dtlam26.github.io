In 2020, I have started my first step in my academic research by enrolling in Electrical and Computer Engineering Master degree at [Seoul National University (SNU)](https://www.topuniversities.com/universities/seoul-national-university). As my passion is building and designing reliable intelligent Computer Vision system, Professor Sang Kyun Cha's [PIDLab][pidl] is the destination that I choose for my master graduate time. His name is well-known in the community and his laboratory provides a vast scope of intelligent projects & researches on Data Life Cycle Management, AI-Explanation System, which yields a grateful opportunity for me to study under his guidance. Under his supervision, I have conducted multiple researches on Distributed Learning, Quantization (Improving AI model inference on Edge Devices), Active Learning (Improving model performance by adding most valuable data samples during a Data Life Cycle), Domain Adaptation (Adapting and tuning a model to a new environment) and Visual Reasoning (Explaining pixel-factor for computer vision model judgment).
