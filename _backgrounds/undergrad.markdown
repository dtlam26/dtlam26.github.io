In 2019, I have completed my Telecommunication BSc degree at [Hanoi University of Science and Technology (HUST)]({{site.career.hust}}) which is one of the biggest technical university in Vietnam. Despite having started as a Telecommunication Engineer, I had a huge passion for Computer Vision (CV) technology and the eruption of AI in intelligent systems. Therefore, during my last three years of an undergradute students, I have focused on learning and working with multiple computer vision research, especially on human and objects interaction. The AICS Lab led by Dr. Vo Le Cuong is my first place to get the insight of theory and experiments for all of those applications such as face detection, pedestrian  recognition, etc. These experience gave me a chance to start working at both big tech enterprises and start-up companies in Vietnam in both intership and full-time employee for later on. Projects from those companies such as VinSmart or TinhVan Group leveraged my abilities not only in intelligent CV applications but also in system management. This experience made me hungry for a broader knowledge in designing intelligent systems and played an important role for me to take my first step in academic research.
