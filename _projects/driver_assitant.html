    <p><strong><em>Features</em></strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Providing surround object distances and their relative velocity</li>
        <li>Counting the number of vehicle during the drive and integrate with public traffic history for a personalized route recommender system</li>
        <li>Secure information at the edge level</li>
      </ul>

    <h3 class="title is-3">Description</h3>
    <p>Drivers, especially taxi drivers, will be handed an edge device controlling their vehicle surrounding cameras. The multi-cameras will capture the object in various views and angles and
    formulate their information into traffic participants candidate. During the drive, objects such as pedestrians, cars, trucks,... will be recorded and stored at encrypted feature level on the edge.
    from that capture, an distance estimation will be provided to alert drivers about surrounding vehicles velocity. Close contacted and high speed vehicle will be informed to avoid accidents from multiple views.
    This helps enable better awareness for the driver.</p>
    <p>After a day, the number of each category object from each drive will be uploaded to the cloud for a route recommender system</p>
