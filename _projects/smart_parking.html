  <p><a href="{{site.pidl}}">PIDLab</a> Project</p>
  <p>
    <strong><em>Goal:</em></strong>
    The project aimed to reduce the effort of control and manage parking spots in multiple parking lots by using computer vision approaches. At the same time, the objective should also provide handy functions to the drivers to choose optimal parking places in term of environment and expense factors.

      <strong><em>Features</em></strong>
      <ul>
        <li>A public website for users to query vacant spots in various parking space at once</li>
        <li>A semi auto-assignment function to help users find their optimal spots</li>
        <li>A real-time occupancy detection based on image captures</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h3 class="title is-3">Description</h3>
    Each edge will handle captures from multiple cameras and provide reliable occupancy detection with high precision quality. The occpancy information is concatenated for a specific parking rate in each parking lot and then stored in a shared database to avoid duplicate information. From the concrete measurements, each parking assignment request can be provided through a query.
