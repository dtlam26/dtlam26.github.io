    <dd>A public website for users to query each incoming vacant seats and capacities of each bus/train/subway </dd>
    <dd>An vibrate sensor at each seat alert long-time seating person(s) in silent to leave their seats for the priotized candidates</dd>

    Each edge will handle a specific task and combine information for the seat allocation priotization.
    Camera information from each edge camera will be in charged of collecting information of entered passengers and their attributes and encrypted them at feature level for tracking and seat duration measurement.
    Some edge computation device will be specially assigned for checking the occupancy of a seat and control sensors under their perspective views. Information of others camera will be aggragated here for concurrent update and decision.
    Then, this information will be publish to a broker for information sharing and project application

      This is a partial demonstation of our project. The demo is conducted in <a href="https://sites.google.com/snu.ac.kr/a2i2/">PIDLab</a> environment.
      We associate the detection with the top-view for handling crowded environment and the front face attribute at the entrance of the door.
      These information is quickly delivered to another edge, in charge of seat management
