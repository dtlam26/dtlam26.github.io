    <p>
      This is a partial demonstation of our project. The demo is conducted in <a href="{{site.career.pidl}}">PIDLab</a> environment.
      We associate the detection with the top-view for handling crowded environment and the front face attribute at the entrance of the door.
      These information is quickly delivered to another edge, in charge of seat management
