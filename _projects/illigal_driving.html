    <p>Even with CCTV support, officers are still struggling to capture every illegal driving behaviours.
      This project is created to catch the illegal driving behviours in real-time manner with high accuracy.
      For a vehicle entering a road, we assume the vehicle will not be occuled during the drive, we can track it efficently through time.
      By predefinding camera calibration information and legal vector direction, we can successfully capture the speed of a vehicle and its direction during its appearance under CCTV.
